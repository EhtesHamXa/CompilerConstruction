# CompilerConstruction
This is the code for C# compiler (not a real compiler).   
I was developing it for my course.   
I only had done Lexical and Syntactical phases.   
This is built by using Ruby (very easy to understand).  
If you are intersted in completing it to the semantical phase, I can help you.
